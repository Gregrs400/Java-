# Introduction
Java++ is a superset of the Java programming language aimed at improving Java by adding additional features and shortcuts to make it easier and more efficient at creating applications. In order to achieve this, Java++ will have symbols to denote access modifiers (+ for public, - for private), 'begin' and 'end' to denote code blocks, replacing 'this' keyword with the class name, adding a built-in swap() function to swap the values of variables much quicker, print() and println() statements for printing to the console, among other improvements. With these new helpful features, developers using Java++ can reduce the number of lines of code written, allowing for more concise applications. As the developers of Java++, we believe short, concise code is important as code is read more often than it is written.
